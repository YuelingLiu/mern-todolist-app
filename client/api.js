// what does a shell do?
// reads commands from stdin and excutes them '

// char * line;
// read lines from user

//The C library function char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream) reads a line from the specified
// stream and stores it into the string pointed to by str.
// It stops when either (n-1) characters are read,
//the newline character is read, or the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.
// while(status){
//     // read lines
